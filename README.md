# Mdopen

`mdopen` is a command tool to preview your Markdown file.

I ever want to write such a tool to preview `README` file in some git repository in terminal. And then I find [mdopen](https://github.com/romanyx/mdopen) witten in Golang before I start. Then I migrate it to Ruby.

Hope it helpful~

## Installation

`mdopen` is a command tool, so you'd better install it as:

    $ gem install mdopen

## Usage

```bash
mdopen <markdown_file>
```

"README" or "README.md" will be used as input filename if the <markdown_file> is omitted or not exists.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
